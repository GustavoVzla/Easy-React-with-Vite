# Event KeyCodes

This project implements an interactive application that displays information about keyboard events (`event.key`, `event.keyCode`, and `event.code`) when the user presses a key, as well as mouse events (`event.type`, `event.clientX`, and `event.clientY`) when the user interacts with the mouse. It is a useful tool for developers who want to better understand how keyboard and mouse events work in JavaScript.
